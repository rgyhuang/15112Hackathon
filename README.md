2. ~~Change its name~~and color (this feature is sus rn)
3. ~~Feed your Axolotl (sus as well)~~
4. ~~Play with your Axoltol in the Code T-racing minigame!~~

## How we built it
We built it using cmu 112 graphics tinker, tinker, and the python language

## Challenges
Because none of us had experience making a virtual pet and it was the first project for many of us, we didn't know whether it is going to work in the end. We had issues like:
- Displaying and moving the Desktop Pet Gif
~~- Generating a 'maze' for our game~~
- Literally everyting lmaooooo

## What we are proud of

Cute Axolotl swimming around XD (plz make it new mascot)
