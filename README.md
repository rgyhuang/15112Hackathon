Taylor also needs to be taken care of too you know, soooooo you can also:
1. Check out the happiness and hunger of your Axolotl
2. Change its name and color
3. Feed your Axolotl
4. Play with your Axoltol in the Code T-racing minigame!

## How we built it
We built it using cmu 112 graphics tinker, tinker, and the python language

## Challenges

- Literally everyting lmaooooo
